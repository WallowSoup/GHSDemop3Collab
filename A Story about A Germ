Germ was left on a surface. It was going to be warm and unwelcoming soon. Germ only had minutes to find a host to replicate.
This was germs first time out of the original host. A sneeze booted them out without warning.

The germ continued to sit there on the table, reflecting on its past.
Being a lonely germ is troublesome, especially when you are used to being around other germs.
Germ was new to this job as well: it was his first day in the nasal cavity. He didn't know how to get back in. Wait- There was a donut! if Germ could move to that, he could re enter the body!
